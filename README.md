# BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. There must be no duplicate nodes. To search a given key in Binary Search Tree, we first compare it with root, if the key is present at root, we return root. If key is greater than root’s key, we recur for right subtree of root node. Otherwise we recur for left subtree.
